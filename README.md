# dotfiles
Arch linux configuration files.

As linux user, we strive to minimize the time we spend on redundant things, like setting up our environment, writing boilerplate code, and basically not doing anything that does not concern the fun part using a PC.

In this context, imagine a perfect world where tiny commands carry out incredibly complex tasks tailored to your needs, where you could buy a new laptop today and install all the tools and packages you need and setup your development environment with nothing but a couple of terminal commands, and where everything is magic.

This digital fairyland can be made, and managed with ease. And there is a name for this magic: dotfiles.
